## Client Instructions

To get started, launch the application on your device. You'll need to enter your server's IP address and select 'Connect' to establish a connection. Once connected, you'll have access to interactive features like 'Swing Hammer' and 'Thump,' which are crucial for engaging with the server's puzzle mechanisms.

## Server Instructions

Begin by starting the application on your device. Level 3 will automatically load. As soon as a client connects, several things will happen simultaneously: a timer will appear in the top left corner of your screen, your player character will be created, and the camera will start following your movements. To interact with the client, use 'Swing Hammer' and then 'Thump.' These actions will activate the Flipper and Spoon mechanisms, respectively, and are essential for progressing through the game's challenges.
